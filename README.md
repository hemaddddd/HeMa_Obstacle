I created three types of glowing boxes and player can get points by running towards them, I also create two types of enemies, and the player needs to kill them with weapons by pressing E key to equip. Player can aim weapon by pressing Right mouse Key, and fire by pressing Left mouse Key.
Red boxes worse 5 points, purpole boxes worse 15 points, green boxes worse 10 points. Enemy 1 worse 1 point, enemy 2 worse 20 points. 
All the boxes and enemies lead the player to the ending area of the game, which is a yellow glowing pad that prints to screen when player reaches it.
I also created a launch pad that will launch the player when player reaches it.
