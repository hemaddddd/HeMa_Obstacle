# HeMa_Obstacle

I wanted to destroy some objects at the top by jumping, but it always ended up destroy the whole map. 
I made the character able to shoot by pressing the left mouse button. 
and I made an explosion effect with sound when double jump.

I for got to push origin when I initially finished editing the assignment and I lost all my progress, but I luckly I didn't foret to save and push origin this time.
